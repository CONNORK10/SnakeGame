Design Suggestions (11/07/24)

Formatting/Style Suggestions:
    1. Although this game is pretty simple to understand, I think you should still add a description in the beginning, even if
    it's only 1 sentence.

    2. The Design Specs are very technical, and could benefit from showing the creative thought process a little more. It feels like AI, which isn't necessarily bad, but I feel like you should reread the sentences and see if you can tweak them to make it more understandable.
        For example: line 13, the controls only talk about what keys the player can press, rather than explaining which directions the player can go in. I guess in this case, it doesn't really matter cause anyone who's touched a game before knows that arrow keys can move them in all four directions; but generally speaking, the technicality of the design specs are a little bit unfit for this type of file. I suggest trying to rewrite it (or asking gpt to write it) as if you were creating instructions for the snake game.

Specifics:
    1. For the game speed (line6), it sounds fine having "slow", "medium", and "fast", but I wonder if it could be a little better by instead having the player select a game difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and telling the player that the difficulty chosen affects the speed of gameplay.
        Adding onto that, it could be cool if there were more game modes that differ from the original in order to make it more interesting (I just read through the whole thing, and you already have a different gamemode, but it could be cool to add more!)
    2. I really like the idea of changing the food and snake colors! Maybe if you want, through unlocking certain achievements or requirements, the player could unlock cool skins or even accessories for the food and snake, rather than just being a solid color! I think that could definitely motivate people to continue playing.
