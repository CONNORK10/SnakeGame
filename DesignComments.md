# Design Suggestions (11/07/24)

## Formatting/Style Suggestions

1. **Game Description**  
   Although this game is pretty simple to understand, I think you should still add a description at the beginning, even if it's only one sentence.

2. **Design Specs Readability**  
   The design specs are very technical and could benefit from showing the creative thought process a little more. It feels like AI, which isn't necessarily bad, but I feel like you should reread the sentences and see if you can tweak them to make it more understandable.  
   For example: in line 13, the controls only talk about what keys the player can press, rather than explaining which directions the player can move in. I guess in this case, it doesn't really matter because anyone who's touched a game before knows that arrow keys can move them in all four directions; but generally speaking, the technicality of the design specs feels a bit unfit for this type of file.  
   I suggest rewriting it (or asking GPT to help) as if you were creating instructions for the Snake game.

## Specific Suggestions

1. **Game Speed & Difficulty**  
   For the game speed (line 6), it sounds fine having "slow", "medium", and "fast", but I wonder if it could be improved by instead allowing the player to select a game difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and telling the player that the difficulty chosen affects the speed of gameplay.  
   Additionally, it could be interesting to add more game modes that differ from the original to make the game more engaging. I noticed you already have a different game mode planned, but perhaps more could be added for variety!

2. **Snake and Food Customization**  
   I really like the idea of changing the food and snake colors! Perhaps, by unlocking certain achievements or meeting requirements, the player could unlock cool skins or accessories for the food and snake, rather than just having a solid color. This could definitely motivate players to continue playing and give them a sense of progression.
